terminal: type sudo mongod to start up local mongo database
	(using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhMdrlgI0Bc method, which is just to use home-brew. no need to edit PATH variable or anything, which tripped me up when i tried by myself) 
	open new terminal window to connect to it…
	    type just ‘mongo’ and it will connect to test the first time
	    type just ‘db’ to see what database you’re connected to
	    type j = {name : ‘asdf’} to assign variable j
	    type db.testData.insert(j) to insert new document to collection “testData”

	Thanks @Mark, I keep forgetting this again and again. 
		After installing MongoDB with Homebrew:		
		* The databases are stored in the /usr/local/var/mongodb/ directory
		* The mongod.conf file is here: /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
		* The mongo logs can be found at /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/		
		* The mongo binaries are here: /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb//bin

	to access in finder: Choose Go to Folder from the Finder's Go menu and provide /usr/local/ as the path.

My Notes on Running LocalHost MongoDB:
1.in 1st terminal window: type sudo mongod to start the localhost mongo database
2.in 2nd terminal window: type mongo to start the shell
	can type “db” to see what database we’re using (“test” by default)
	can type db.getCollectionNames() to see what collections (tables) are in db
	can query mongo directly in this shell application, instead of using python scripts:
		db.[collection].find().pretty() <- can’t use the pretty() method outside of the shell…
3.save python code as .py files somewhere
	python code should start with... 
		from pymongo import MongoClient
		client = MongoClient(“mongoldb://localhost:27017”)
		db =  client.test #this is the db name
		for x in db.[collection].find():
			print x #print all documents in [collection]. use pprint.pprint(x) since we can’t use .pretty() outside of shell (example: in python scripts)
	use csv (with open([path],'r') as f: ...) to read csv as dictionary and then use db.[colletion].insert(dict row) to insert data into mongo
4.run python scripts in 3rd terminal window: type python [filename].py
	may need to change directory of the 3rd terminal window to wherever we saved the file:
		example: typed “cd ~/Desktop” to change directory to the desktop folder
		use “ls” to see all files in current directory
		use "cd ./[sub folder name]" to enter a subfolder of the current directory
		use "cd .." to navigate up one folder

	^that answer helped me when i messed up my PATH and couldn’t even use “ls” command… after that i just used homebrew to install mongo and had zero issues
	@bmike thanks! added that to .bash_profile and it's all working now. had to open .bash_profile like this:/usr/bin/vi ~/.bash_profile

	export PATH="/Users/ben/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
